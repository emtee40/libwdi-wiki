[BUGFIXES]
o deviceless external hub random failure on descriptors. Is there anything we can do?
  => trace what's happening on the bus
o SetupDI### call enumerates composite devices at the root ("usbccgp") rather than the leaves ("WinUSB") 
  => trying to obtain the FULL path (i.e. path that works with CreateFile) of the WinUSB leaves of a composite device handled by usbccgp is an absolute nightmare! 
     For now, just replace the composite driver with a WinUSB one. Install is a pain (must force upgrade), but it works. ["FIXED": 2009.12.16]
o Well, above doesn't work for interface selection through WinUsb_GetAssociatedInterface (what the ???)
  => back to the (more versatile) separate MI_## for composite devices' interfaces ["RE-FIXED": 2009.12.17]
o poll says control fd overlapped IO complete [FIXED with a "poll we can believe in": 2009.12.22]

o crashes in pthreadGC2.dll when poll is unhappy about an fd [FIXED: 2010.01.07]
o doesn't use the default pthread-win32 library name on MinGW [FIXED: 2010.01.11]
o the infamous device with serial => no port# issue on XP [FIXED: 2010.01.12]

o cancelling transfers after a timeout leads to an infinite wait on the remaining fds (is this an issue in core?) [yup. FIXED: 2010.01.22]
o repeated "[libusb_get_next_timeout] first timeout already expired" messages on timeout cancellation [FIXED (Michael Plante): 2010.01.24]
