= Pete's backlog or "Why is feature X not being worked on?" =

== Background ==
Being involved in multiple Open Source projects at once makes for an interesting scheduling challenge.

Every so often (usually more than I'd like to have to answer), I get asked about the state of feature X with regards to one of these projects, and when I think it will be available. Because of this, I have decide to create a page that I can simply point to to try to answer that question.

The first thing you should understand, and this is unfortunately true for most Open Source developers, is: as much as we would like, we cannot spend our entire days coding and adding features to our Open Source projects. Most of us also hold a 9 to 5 job, in companies that usually have little interest in fostering their employee's Open Source initiatives. At least, this is my case. Even worse, the company I currently work for goes as far as actively prohibits access to sites like SourceForge.net from their network. :(

What this means for '''you''' is that, for the best part of the day, I do not have the possibility to engage in anything Open Source related and as a result the time I can spend working on the features highlighted below is quite limited and this negatively impacts how soon a feature you may wish for will happen (if it happens at all), especially as I have my fingers in more than one pie.

But, without further ado, please find below, more or less in the order I plan to tackle it, the current state of my backlog. I am also providing estimates of the time I think adding the feature, without any other distractions, would take. But I must stress out that this is a best case scenario, only likely to occur if I can devote all my free time on the task, which rarely happens. More realistically, you want to at least double these times, as well as remember that these estimates are by no means the promise of an ETA.

For the record, if anything happens there [http://libusbx.org libusbx] '''always''' take precedence. The reason is that the project is quite new and is a fork in direct competition with a well established one, and so requires every bit of commitment it can get.</br/>
